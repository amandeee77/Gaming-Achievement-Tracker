        <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
        <p>
          Gaming Achievement Tracker is a simple, elegant way for players to log and reflect on their in-game accomplishments—no accounts or logins required. Most trackers feel cluttered or impersonal, so I designed this app to be visually engaging and easy to use.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The app uses the RAWG API to fetch game cover art and genre data, stores achievement entries in MongoDB, and presents everything in a clean, responsive interface. Whether you're trophy hunting or just tracking progress, it makes your gaming journey more rewarding.
